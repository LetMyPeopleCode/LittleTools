#Time Addition Calculator
Just put all the files in the same directory and open calc.html in your browser.

Enter times with dot separators:
     hours[optional].minutes[optional].seconds. 
	 
Hitting the plus (+) or enter keys on the keypad finishes an entry (if it's just numbers and dots - if not, nope). You can retroactively remove the last entry from the list or clear the whole thing.
