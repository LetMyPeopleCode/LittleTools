# SmallRecorder

SmallRecorder is a fork of a fork of Matt Diamond's immensely useful Recorder.js, which makes it simple to record audio from a user's microphone (with their permission) using HTML5. The purpose of SmallRecorder is to turn the captured audio into a simple 16khz mono WAV format binary blob for easy consumption by and transmission to a number of services.

## How To Use

Initializing the recorder:
```
function initializeRecorder() {

    function startUserMedia(stream) {
        var input = audio_context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
        recorder = new Recorder(input);
       }
       
    try {
        // webkit shim
        window.AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext || window.mozAudioContext || window.oAudioContext;
        navigator.getUserMedia = navigator.mozGetUserMedia || navigator.getUserMedia || navigator.webkitGetUserMedia;
        window.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL;
        audio_context = new AudioContext();
    } catch (e) {
        alert('No web audio support in this browser!');
    }

    navigator.getUserMedia({ audio: true }, startUserMedia, function (e) {
    });
}
```

Start a recording:
```
recorder.clear(); // do this to clear the audio buffer or you'll append
recorder && recorder.record();
```

Stop a recording and get the buffer contents as a 16khz mono wav:
```
recorder && recorder.stop();
recorder && recorder.exportWAV(function (blob) {
    //do stuff with the blob
});
```
